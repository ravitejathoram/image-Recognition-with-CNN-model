## Description:

- In this work, I trained a CNN classifier using Keras with the guidelines described in Deep Learning with Python.
- My strategy is using 20% of the train data (12000 data rows) as a validation set to optimize the classifier, while keeping test data to finally evaluate the accuracy of the model on the data it has never seen.
